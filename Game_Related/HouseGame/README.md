# House Game

### This is the first project that I did after having spent a couple of weeks learning Python(and programming in general). It's horrible code, but I was quite happy with the result.
This was part of a MSc project for some student who decided to pay someone else to do it, and that else was a friend of mine whom I asked if I could do it in their stead for practice.
